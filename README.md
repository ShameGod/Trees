# Trees

## Definition : 
The trees is a data structure that is used to representy hirerachical data. Something that is **not** possible in linear structures.

the top is the root and the children are called nodes. the nodes without any children are called leaves. 

To iterate over all the nodes of a tree data structure there are two solutions : 
* Breadth-level traversal : to check the tree by level.
* depth-first traversal : we check all the children of a node before moving to the next
